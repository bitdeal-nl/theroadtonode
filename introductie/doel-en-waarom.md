# Purpose en goals

Bitcoin is an amazing technology. A network containing computers who are all running [a piece of code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). These computers we call nodes and together they form the Bitcoin network. However, not every user owns a node. Many users will already get a headache by the thought of setting up a node. With this guide I want to change that. To follow this guide you will need the following things:

* **curiosity**, without curiosity you won't get far;
* **time**, the estimated time you will need to fulfill a step is written down at the beginning of each step;
* **money**, always pesky, but you will need around â‚¬190.

Setting up your own node is not necessarily the only way to use bitcoin. You can always make use of exchanges or other platforms. But if you use Bitcoin without your own node you will always trade a piece of your privacy and you will always have to trust a third party. With this guide you will be able to set up a Bitcoin and Lightning node that will work entirely behind [Tor network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)). An additional advantage will be the possibility to connect to your node from all over the world. Without worrying about [dynamic-IP](https://whatismyipaddress.com/dynamic-static) or the need of opening ports on your home router.

Besides that, setting up a node will be very educational. You will get a better understanding of the technical side of Bitcoin. How deep you want to dive is up to you. Not all parts of the guide are mandatory and the order of doing things is not set in stone. You can make a selection of the parts that are useful to you and your situation.
